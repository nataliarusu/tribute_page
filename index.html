          <p>
            Louis Pasteur was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for
            his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial
            fermentation, and pasteurization.

          <div class="summary-content">
            <p>
              Louis Pasteur was born on 27 December 1822, in Dole, Jura, France,
              to a Catholic family of a poor tanner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pasteur entered primary school in 1831. He was an average student
              in his early years, and not particularly academic, as his
              interests were fishing and sketching.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1839, he entered the Collège Royal at Besançon to study
              philosophy and earned his Bachelor of Letters degree in 1840.
              Later in 1842, Pasteur took the entrance test for the École
              Normale Supérieure.He passed the first set of tests, but because
              his ranking was low, Pasteur decided not to continue and try again
              next year.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1843, he passed the test with a high ranking and entered the
              École Normale Supérieure. In 1845 he received the licencié ès
              sciences degree.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1846, he was appointed professor of physics at the Collège de
              Tournon (now called Lycée Gabriel-Faure) in Ardèche. But the
              chemist Antoine Jérôme Balard wanted him back at the École Normale
              Supérieure as a graduate laboratory assistant. He joined Balard
              and simultaneously started his research in crystallography and in
              1847, he submitted his two theses, one in chemistry and the other
              in physics.
            </p>
            <p>
              After serving briefly as professor of physics at the Dijon Lycée
              in 1848, he became professor of chemistry at the University of
              Strasbourg, where he met and courted Marie Laurent, daughter of
              the university's rector in 1849. They were married on 29 May 1849,
              and together had five children, only two of whom survived to
              adulthood.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1868, Pasteur suffered a severe brain stroke that paralysed the
              left side of his body, but he recovered. A stroke or uremia in
              1894 severely impaired his health.Failing to fully recover, he
              died on 28 September 1895, near Paris. He was given a state
              funeral and was buried in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, but his
              remains were reinterred in the Pasteur Institute in Paris, in a
              vault covered in depictions of his accomplishments in Byzantine
              mosaics.

          Why did his research in chemistry lead to remarkable breakthroughs
        </h2>
        <div class="research-descriprion">
          Louis Pasteur is best known for inventing the process that bears his
          name, pasteurization. Pasteurization is a heat-treatment process that
          destroys pathogenic microorganisms in certain foods and beverages.
          During the study he had a long road of discoveries.

            <h3>Building Blocks of Life</h3>
            <p>
              Pasteur showed that otherwise identical molecules could exist as
              mirror images (or ‘left’ and ‘right-handed’ versions.) He noticed
              that molecules produced by living things were always left-handed
              which lead to being the foundation stone for microbiology.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Disapproved of Age-Long Theory</h3>
            <p>
              For numerous years, people thought life appeared spontaneously,
              that fleas grew from dust, or maggots from dead flesh. Pasteur
              finally disproved this theory and showed that food went off
              because of contamination by micron in the air. He went on to argue
              that these could cause disease. This also lead to his “germ
              theory”.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Wine That You Relish</h3>
            <p>
              All over the Europe the biggest problem was how to save the wine,
              when Pasteur realised this was due to contamination. He noticed
              that boiling wine to kill bacteria made it taste terrible. In a
              series of experiments, Pasteur discovered that heating wine to 55
              degrees killed bacteria without ruining the taste. This process,
              later named as pasteurisation, saved the wine industry. Today,
              it’s widely used to keep food free from disease. He once said, “A
              bottle of wine contains more philosophy than all the books in the
              world.”
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Mysterious Silkworm Disease</h3>
            <p>
              After protecting the Wine Industry, He worked out on protecting
              the Silk Industry. He studied that infection was transmitted by
              parasites, and showed how infected worms should be isolated and
              destroyed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Chicken Cholera</h3>
            <p>
              Pasteur injected some bacteria into his chickens. The birds fell
              ill, but unexpectedly did not die. As a result though, they were
              resistant to fresh cholera injections. Pasteur realised that
              weakened strains of a disease could help animals develop immunity.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Anthrax</h3>
            <p>
              Anthrax is fatal to human beings and can easily wipe off an entire
              farm full of animals. Louis announced the vaccination for the
              disease after the German scientist Robert Koch foudn the bacteria
              which is responsible for Anthrax.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Turning Attention To Dogs</h3>
            <p>
              Pasteur turned his attention to rabies soon afterwards. He made a
              vaccination for dogs but was unsure of testing it on humans until
              he found Joseph Meister, a boy bitten by a rabid animal.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Pasteur Institute</h3>
            <p>
              Founded by Louis Pasteur, this institute was a landmark in the
              expansion in the research of infectious diseases.
